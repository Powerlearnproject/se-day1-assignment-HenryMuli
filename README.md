Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Its importance is that it ensures the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages inthe 1950s. This saw the development of languages like Fortran developed by John Backus.
Advent of structured programming in the 1970s. This saw the development of languages like Pascal developed by Nicklaus Wirth as a teaching language.
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. These centre on developing software in a flexible, fast paced and open minded manner.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This involves the gathering and documentig of user needs and system requirements. The information forms the building blocs of the project. A Software Requirement Specification is utlized to specif all the requirements for target software.
Design: Multiple designs for product architecture are presesnted in Design Document Specification and after evaluation, the most practical and logicL design is chosen for development
Implementation: Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployement: Involves releasing the software to users
Maintenance: Involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental appproach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. 
Waterfall methodology is best for projects where: the requirements are clear and likely not to change, small projects with low risk, less experienced teams, minimal client and stakeholder involvement, longer development time, little future maintenance and strict time and budget limits.
Agile methodology on the other hand is bets for projects where: teh requirements are unclear and likely to change, large projects with high risk, more experienced teams, frequent client and shareholder involvement, quick release needeed, continuous updates and support and flexible time and budget limits

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurane Enginner: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Planning, execution and delivery of software solutions

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments like VisualStudio provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code
Version Control Systems like Git are essential for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements can be overcome through use of agile methodologies since client and stakeholder input can be dealt with easier
Tight dealnes can be overcome through use of agile methodologies since they focus on quick project completion
Technical debt can be overcoe through use of tools and code analysis to pinpoint areas with technical debt that need improvement, implementig robust automated testing, enforcing coding standards and conducting code reviews.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: Involves testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing: Involves testing iteration between different components or subsystems
System testing: Involves testing the entire software system as a whole to verify if it meets functional and technical requirements
Acceptance testing: Involves testing software against user requirements 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the art and science of optimizing prompts to guide AI models towards generating desired responses. It allows for one to communicate effectvely with AI nad utilize its full potential. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a story about female genital mutilation in Kenya
Write a short story from the perspective of a girl, named Resian, who is yet to experience female genital mutilation, but lives in a community that it. It should depict the desire of the girl not to undergo it but her family onstantly pushing for it. The tone should show the grim situation the girl is facing. The story should be full of suspense. It should be written in English. It should utlise both long and short sentences and have a happy ending for the girl.
